# Changelog

## 1.12.1-public — 2026-09-15

- The two tests that call `refresh()` directly now skip, instead of erroring, when the running interpreter has no stdlib `tomllib`. The CLI path is unaffected: `ensure_refresh_runtime()` re-execs into an installed Python 3.11+. The 1.12.0 entry recorded "43 tests passed" without naming the interpreter.
- `test_process_channels` no longer inherits the runner's stdin. `codex-hook-adapter.py` reads stdin to EOF by design; the second subprocess call passed no `input=`, so the whole suite blocked whenever it was started with an open stdin. Reproduced deterministically: killed at the timeout with stdin open, 0.057s with stdin closed.
- README states the interpreter requirement as a skip condition rather than a hard prerequisite.
- ICM guidance unchanged; its documented limits were re-checked against arXiv 2603.16021v2 §4.6, §5.2 and §6, and the stage folder naming against upstream `_core/CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Validation: 43 tests OK under Python 3.13; 43 OK with 2 skipped under Python 3.9.6. `catalog/index.json` still ships empty; no workstation paths, inventories or review transcripts are included.

## 1.12.0-public — 2026-09-14

- Initial public distribution with fresh history, generic examples and no workstation inventory or internal audit records.
- Includes ICM context guidance, scope/risk classification, verification helpers and existing regression tests.
- Deployment hints defer to project tooling and environment; no assumed private infrastructure.
- Optional integrations remain separately installed and subject to their own instructions.
- Made the skill-search test independent of any workstation catalog using temporary fixtures.
- Validation: 43 tests passed, isolated two-host installation/doctor passed, skill and secret scans passed. Independent review unavailable; owner explicitly authorized public release as aos-plus.
- Published package name: aos-plus; installed skill name remains aos.
